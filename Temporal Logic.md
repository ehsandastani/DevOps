# Temporal Logic

Before introducing temporal logic to those unfamiliar with classical logic, we provide a review of classical logic as follows.

## Review of Classical Logic
Briefly, when defining __logic__, it is better to say __logic__ just represents an abstraction of the world.

First, let's define some terms that will be important later.

### Logical Language
A logical language is a formal system consisting of symbols and rules for constructing well-formed formulas. It includes logical symbols (like "∧", "∨", "→", "∀", "∃"), non-logical symbols (predicates, functions, constants), and variables. A logical language defines how statements are written, but it does not interpret their meaning (that’s the role of models).

Logic has two branches:
* __Model theory__: Concerned with the interpretation of formal languages and their models.
* __Proof theory__: Focuses on the syntactic structure and formal derivations in logical systems.
